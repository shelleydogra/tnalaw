                      <h3><a href="#">bankruptcy </a></h3>
                      <p>I have 7 years of experience in Bankruptcy Law and I have worked on a wide variety of matters when dealing with Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 filings.  I have helped clients ranging from liquidating some credit card debts, all the way to reorganizing debts to help clients stop a foreclosure sale of their home.   I have always consulted with my clients and let them know what is best for them, even if it means to not file Bankruptcy.   I understand that debt creates many stresses and I strive my best to assist my clients with their wishes.</p>

                     <h3><a href="#">real estate</a></h3>
                     <p>I have 8 years of experience in Real Estate Law and I have worked on deals ranging from residential deals to commercial deals.  I understand that buying a home is a major step in everyone's lives and it can create a lot of anxiety.  In additional to buying a home, selling a home requires a knowledgeable attorney to ensure a successful transaction.  I am here to help my clients navigate the home purchase, or home sale process, for a smooth transaction.</p>
